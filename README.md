Scripts I write inspired by work done at The Crypsis Group that I write in full-on downtime so I know I can freely open source.


## MBOXparse.py

Parses MBOX files into a JSON file to make it easier to ingest into mass analysis and programming. PSTs, though with potential loss, can be converted to MBOX using readpst on Linux (part of libpst).
